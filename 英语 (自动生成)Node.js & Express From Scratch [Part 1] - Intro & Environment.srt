1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,040
hey what's going on guys welcome to a

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,200
new series now for those of you waiting

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,629
on laravel the premium course the crash

4
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:08,639
course and the youtube project should

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,230
all be released within the next few

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,540
weeks so in this series what we're going

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,000
to be doing is creating a nodejs and

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,070
express application from absolute

9
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,430
scratch so the idea of this series is to

10
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,760
be very very beginner friendly and to be

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,279
kind of a continuation off of my node.js

12
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:29,160
for beginners crash course alright so

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,960
after people finish that this gives them

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,700
the opportunity to actually create a

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,700
project with node and express in a bunch

16
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,309
of other technologies ok so this will be

17
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:39,930
from absolute scratch we're going to

18
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,489
start on a machine that doesn't even

19
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:44,280
have no js' or Express or MongoDB

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,160
installed we're going to go through the

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,969
installations we're going to set up the

22
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:50,219
environment and then there's going to be 
no generators no copying and pasting the

24
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,050
goal of this is to write and explain

25
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,000
every line of code so that you guys can

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,430
really grasp what's going on as opposed

27
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,410
to just watching a demo of an app being

28
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,510
built alright so if you have a little

29
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,760
experience with node and express in

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,549
MongoDB that's great if you don't even

31
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:09,869
know what those are I would suggest

32
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,630
watching these three videos here they're

33
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,060
there on my channel I was just watching

34
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,250
those before tempting the course or the

35
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,619
series alright now as far as the

36
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,210
application goes it's going to be very

37
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,640
simple in terms of functionality at

38
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,259
least at first we're going to be able to

39
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,689
create read update and delete articles

40
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:31,380
stored in a MongoDB database from our

41
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,409
node and Express app all right so let's

42
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:36,299
take a look at some of the technologies

43
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,460
that we'll be using and learning so

44
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,280
nodejs and npm nodejs is a JavaScript

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,500
runtime and server-side technology and

46
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,020
it comes with NPM which is node package

47
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,149
manager and this is used to install

48
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,700
modules like Express and thousands of

49
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,100
others okay so Express is a back-end

50
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,689
framework for building powerful

51
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,869
applications web applications

52
00:01:56,869 --> 00:01:59,990
MongoDB which is a no SQL database

53
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,579
mongoose which is an ORM or an object

54
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,979
relational mapper and this allows our

55
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,369
application to interface with MongoDB

56
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:10,289
we'll be using the pug template engine

57
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,270
for our views pug is formally known as J

58
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,220
we'll be installing bootstrap a few

59
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,840
videos in and we're going to use Bower

60
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,940
for that which is a front-end package

61
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,730
manager similar to NPM we'll also do a

62
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,100
little bit of jQuery and Ajax to make

63
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,130
delete requests to our server alright so

64
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,930
I try not to mention this stuff too much

65
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,910
but I do have a patreon if you guys want

66
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,830
to support this channel directly even

67
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,590
$1.00 per month is greatly appreciated

68
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,820
if there's enough people that can help

69
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,890
out then I'll be able to do this stuff

70
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,530
full-time which is my goal and I'm also

71
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,750
working on some exclusive content and

72
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,540
perks for patrons for one-time donations

73
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,060
I have a paypal dot me account and then

74
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,739
if you're interested in premium courses

75
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:52,840
I have affiliate links at traversée

76
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,390
Mediacom slash edge' wanax courses

77
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,310
alright and I will be creating my own

78
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,160
courses very very soon so that's it guys

79
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,810
let's go ahead and get started on this

80
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,140
project and hopefully you enjoy it

81
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,220
alright guys in this video we're going

82
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,350
to be setting up our environment so

83
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,730
we're going to install a couple things

84
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,310
to build our application now I'm using

85
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,750
Windows because I want this to be

86
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,030
completely beginner friendly and I know

87
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,230
that a lot of people that are just

88
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,890
getting into web development and so on

89
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,660
maybe on Windows alright

90
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,160
but this is completely cross-platform

91
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,890
all the code we write everything it

92
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,320
doesn't matter what system you're on

93
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,430
alright so we're going to install a

94
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,320
couple things of course we need nodejs

95
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,700
and nodejs is a JavaScript runtime if

96
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,370
you have no clue what nodejs is I would

97
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,070
suggest watching my node for beginners

98
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,900
video we're going to install that that

99
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,760
also comes with NPM which is node

100
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,220
package manager and that's a command

101
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,870
line tool that we can use to install

102
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,940
different modules like Express and

103
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,680
Mongoose and so on

104
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,180
alright we're also going to need a

105
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,120
database and we're going to use MongoDB

106
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,799
long would you be is a no SQL database

107
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:02,620
if you want to learn more about Mongo

108
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,110
I'd suggest my MongoDB in 30 minutes

109
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,200
video I also just did a video called a

110
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,959
guide to know SQL databases if you want

111
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,010
to learn more about no SQL in general

112
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,479
we're also going to be using atom which

113
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,419
is a text editor this is what I've been

114
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:22,930
using for the most part lately and it's

115
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,330
it's a really nice editor it's by github

116
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,950
it's very very

117
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,700
well as far as looks and themes and it

118
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,490
also has a bunch of packages that you

119
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,770
can install that will help you with

120
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,240
development so we're going to install

121
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,170
that and then sensitive on Windows we

122
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,030
need a better command line because the

123
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,820
the standard CMD command line in Windows

124
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,920
is garbage so we're going to be using

125
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,000
git bash okay so this right here get SCM

126
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,490
comm you can download it it's going to

127
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,890
download the git version control system

128
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,410
along with the command line tool called

129
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,690
git bash alright so let's get started

130
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,760
first thing we'll do is install nodejs

131
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,110
so we're going to just go ahead and

132
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,580
click here we're going to get the

133
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,680
recommended version which is at this

134
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,280
time six point ten point three and

135
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,450
that's going to just be an installer

136
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,310
we'll just go through it quickly

137
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:21,070
alright so let's open it up and just go

138
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,350
through this we'll click Next and it's

139
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,330
going to go into your Program Files if

140
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:33,840
you're on Windows click Next and install

141
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,670
alright and it's as easy as that nodejs

142
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,180
and NPM is now installed so next thing

143
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,710
we're going to do is we're going to

144
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,860
install MongoDB so let's go ahead and go

145
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:50,830
to C download and there's a few steps

146
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,170
that we need to do here some of which

147
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,360
are in the command line but it's not too

148
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,520
bad so we're going to grab the yeah

149
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,630
windows 64-bit 2008 and later and that's

150
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,820
going to download the MSI file so this

151
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,280
is another installer that we need to go

152
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,300
through and it is a hundred and forty

153
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,220
eight megabytes so it may take a couple

154
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,640
minutes to download so once it's

155
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,410
downloaded just open it up and we're

156
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,860
going to go through this next and I'm

157
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,570
going to click custom right here because

158
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,180
I want to change the install path by

159
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,360
default it's going to be Program Files

160
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,310
MongoDB server and then the version I

161
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,590
don't want that I want it to be right in

162
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,729
the C Drive

163
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:45,520
so let's go to local C Drive and what

164
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,169
I'll do here is create a new folder

165
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:51,580
called MongoDB alright and that's where

166
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,150
we want this to be installed c / MongoDB

167
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,839
will click Next and then install and

168
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:04,960
it's going to go through the setup okay

169
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,150
so we'll click finish now there's a

170
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,939
couple extra steps we need to take we

171
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:11,919
need to go into that folder that we just

172
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,469
installed it in so for me it's going to

173
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:17,860
be C Drive MongoDB and we're going to

174
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,509
create a folder here called data alright

175
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,279
and then inside the data folder we're

176
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:26,229
going to create another folder called DB

177
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:28,569
this is where all of our data will be

178
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:32,559
stored now we have to also create a

179
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:37,199
log-log folder so it's a new folder log

180
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,430
alright and then we need to open up a

181
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,110
command line and I haven't installed git

182
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,029
bash yet so we'll just use the standard

183
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:47,949
command prompt so it's a CMD and we'll

184
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:53,219
run that as administrator okay and then

185
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:55,810
let's see so I'm going to navigate to

186
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,370
that folder so we want to go to CD

187
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:04,300
MongoDB and we actually want to go in

188
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,029
the bin folder alright if we look at

189
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:09,490
what's in there oops can't do that

190
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,930
there is a vis MongoDB XE that's the

191
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,990
main program so we need to run that with

192
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,139
some options or some flags so let's say

193
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:23,580
Mongo D and then we're going to do - -

194
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,839
let me make this a little bigger so you

195
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,649
guys can see it see I haven't done this

196
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:31,319
in a while

197
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:35,500
font let's make it 28 there we go

198
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:41,740
alright so Mongo D directory oops why

199
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,459
isn't that typing directory and it's

200
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:49,029
going to be per DB okay directory / DB

201
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:52,330
and then - - DB path

202
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:55,360
and then we want to define that data

203
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,399
path that we created so it's going to be

204
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:01,959
in your MongoDB MongoDB folder slash

205
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:05,110
data slash the B okay that's the folder

206
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,180
we just created so what we're doing is

207
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,430
we're specifying the database path as

208
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,980
that folder all right or that location

209
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,790
then we need to specify the log path

210
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,720
okay so that is going to be C slash

211
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,779
MongoDB slash log and it's going to be a

212
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:25,540
file called Hmong Mongo dot log and

213
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,089
it'll create that on its own then we

214
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:29,529
just want to add a couple more flags

215
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:33,370
here - - log append

216
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,750
we also want to do dash dash rest and

217
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,120
dash dash install ok and then that will

218
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,640
install it as a service so that it runs

219
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,500
in the background we don't have to

220
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,390
manually start and stop at all the time

221
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:46,990
and so on

222
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,010
so let's go ahead and click enter and

223
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,680
next thing we want to do is start the

224
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,440
MongoDB service so to do that we can say

225
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:02,529
net start MongoDB okay now it says the

226
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:04,779
services started successfully so that's

227
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:07,300
it MongoDB is now installed it's running

228
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,089
and we can now interact with it from

229
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:14,260
from our application so let's go ahead

230
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,600
and close that up and then we're going

231
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,370
to move on we're going to install Adam

232
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:21,040
which is the text editor so I'm just

233
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,910
going to click download all right so

234
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,290
once that's done we're just going to

235
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:31,750
open that up and the Adam installer is

236
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,100
is really weird because it does

237
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,990
everything behind the scenes you'll see

238
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,290
this little splash screen and then once

239
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,029
it's done it'll just be installed on

240
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:45,250
your system alright Adam is it Adam was

241
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,980
actually created with JavaScript it uses

242
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,740
electron which is a JavaScript framework

243
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,140
that allows you to build desktop

244
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,630
applications with JavaScript which is

245
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,390
really cool and I do have an intro to

246
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,790
electron video if you're interested in

247
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,499
that

248
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:05,349
all right so it's installed Adam and

249
00:11:05,349 --> 00:11:08,049
started it up I'm just going to get rid

250
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:10,149
of this stuff this is just because I had

251
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:12,249
it installed previously so let me just

252
00:11:12,249 --> 00:11:14,589
remove that project and then this is

253
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:17,529
just kind of a welcome screen if you

254
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:19,719
want to open a project install packages

255
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:21,489
and so on but we're going to close all

256
00:11:21,489 --> 00:11:24,789
that up and will most likely install

257
00:11:24,789 --> 00:11:26,319
some packages but we're going to do that

258
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:29,079
later on all right so we can close that

259
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:30,819
for now and then we're going to move on

260
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:33,459
to install git and get bash so let's

261
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,139
click this download for Windows if

262
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:36,759
you're using a Mac you can go to

263
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:39,759
download slash Mac and get this same

264
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:45,039
same program all right so that's going

265
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:50,289
to start it's only 35 megabytes so it

266
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:55,299
shouldn't take too long to download all

267
00:11:55,299 --> 00:12:02,499
right so we'll open that up and we're

268
00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:03,639
just going to go through this it's going

269
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,739
to install it in your Program Files and

270
00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:08,319
then for this we'll just leave all the

271
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,619
defaults and then when you see this

272
00:12:11,619 --> 00:12:14,139
option I always choose this because this

273
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:17,049
will add optional UNIX tools to the

274
00:12:17,049 --> 00:12:19,899
regular Windows command prompt so for

275
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:22,389
instance LS you saw that I tried doing

276
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:24,189
that in the regular command line and it

277
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:27,759
didn't work so it'll add that it'll add

278
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,079
a whole bunch of stuff so I always

279
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:31,149
choose that and then for the rest of

280
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:32,559
this stuff we're going to leave the

281
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,239
default open SSL library that's good

282
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:41,919
windows style click Next Next and enable

283
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:43,720
filesystem caching we'll leave that

284
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,029
credential manager we'll leave that and

285
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:53,079
we'll click install all right so that's

286
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:54,849
all set now

287
00:12:54,849 --> 00:12:57,069
let's go ahead and click launch git bash

288
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:59,769
and then this is the command-line tool

289
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:01,539
so we can make this bigger with can

290
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:03,819
holding ctrl and then scroll the mouse

291
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:06,669
wheel and just to check to make sure

292
00:13:06,669 --> 00:13:09,099
that node is installed we can say node

293
00:13:09,099 --> 00:13:13,059
dash B you can see we have version six

294
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:14,709
point seven point three and we can also

295
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:15,730
say NP

296
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:22,689
- B and we have version three point

297
00:13:22,689 --> 00:13:25,329
seven point ten so that's it for setting

298
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:27,609
setting up our environment in the next

299
00:13:27,609 --> 00:13:30,189
video we're going to start - to build

300
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:32,319
out our application will create our

301
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:35,319
package JSON file and we'll go from

302
00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:37,410
there
